A credit plan is always tied to a recipient in order to ensure full reconciliation and accounting of donations. All nonprofits have business rules that govern how hard and soft credits are applied, but these rules are notoriously inconsistent from organization to organization. For example, we recently surveyed 12 enterprise nonprofits about how they handle third-party (corporate) giving crediting. Of those organizations, half of them soft credit the corporation and hard credit the individual donors, and the other half hard credit the third-party organization that provides the matching gift payments. (For example, Benevity is a third-party gift-management company.) Still other organizations hard credit the corporations themselves. For example, Jane Smith works at Microsoft and donates $50 through that company. Microsoft matches the gift dollar for dollar, but Benevity collects and distributes the gift to Oxfam International. Where is hard and soft credit applied? Some organizations hard credit Jane Smith $100 ($50 donated plus the $50 match). Other organizations hard credit Jane Smith $50 and Microsoft $50. Some organizations hard credit Microsoft $100. Still more organizations hard credit Benevity some or all of the $100 donation.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_CreditRecipient)|
